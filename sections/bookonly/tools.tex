  \item ImageJ (Fiji distribution).

    \item \url{http://fiji.sc}
    \item We use the Fiji distribution since it has ScriptEditor, a handy editor for writing macro. 
  \end{itemize}
  \item ImageJ Plugin: EMBL\_sampleimages-1.0.0.jar
  \begin{itemize}
     \item This plugin allows you to download sample image stacks. All the image files mentioned in this ``ImageJ Macro Language'' module could be opened by selecting the file name in \ijmenu{[EMBL > Sample Images >]}. Specified image file in the EMBL web server is then downlaoded and appears on your desktop.
    \item This plugin could be installed in one of the two following ways:
    \item First, using the ``Update Sites'' function in Fiji. Add ``CMCI-EMBL'' to your update sites by the updater interface that could be acceded via \ijmenu{[Help > Update Fiji]}. This ``update site'' function is pretty new in Fiji and usable with the latest Fiji version (2014\~)        
    \item Second, download the plugin from \url{http://cmci.embl.de/downloads/coursemodules}.
